This is an interactive profile page for a trip around the U.S. The page has multiple popup windows that allow the user to change the profile information as well as add and remove cards. Technologies used include grid layout, flexbox, and basic javascript for functionality. The page is fully responsive for any browser resolution including mobile phones.  

In order for the user to add a card to the page, they will need to provide a link as well as the name of the picture. These following links can be used to test the functionality of the page.
